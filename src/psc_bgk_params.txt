// Pretty much anything can go here. The first word on each line is a parameter name, and the second word is the parameter value.
// Words are separated by SPACES. Any words after the first two of a line are ignored, as are any lines with <2 words.
// Duplicate parameter names are overridden.
// For example, "//" will be parsed as a parameter and will have value "For".
